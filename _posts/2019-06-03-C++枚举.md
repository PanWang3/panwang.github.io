### 定义
- 枚举的一般形式
```
enum 枚举类型名 {标识符列表};
enum weekday {Sunday,Monday,Thesday,Wednesday,Thursday,Friday,Saturday};
```

- 带赋值的枚举类型
```
enum 枚举类型名
{
    标识符 [=整型常数],
    ...
    标识符 [=整型常数],
}枚举变量;
enum weekday
{
    Sunday = 0,
    Monday = 1,
    Thesday = 2,
    Wednesday = 3,
    Thursday = 4,
    Friday = 5,
    Saturday = 6
};
```

### 运算

***枚举值相当于整型变量***

- 判断比较
- 利用枚举类型做加减法运算,枚举值可以直接进行加减法运算
```
    enum weekday
    {
        Sunday = 0,
        Monday = 1,
        Thesday = 2,
        Wednesday = 3,
        Thursday = 4,
        Friday = 5,
        Saturday = 6
    };

    weekday m_week1;
    weekday m_week2;
    weekday m_week3;
    m_week1 = Saturday;
    m_week2 = Monday;
    m_week3 = Thesday;
    cout << m_week1 - m_week2 << endl;
    cout << m_week2 + m_week3 << endl;
```
